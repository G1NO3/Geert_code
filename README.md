# My_code
Some sample codes written by myself.  
You can follow this order to know better about me:  
1) DL/Neurodynamics... It includes the models I'm working on now and you can see how I combine the latest result of AI with my present work. Hope you can get complete understanding of my coding style through this;
2) Reinforcement Learning/Big industrial code... It is a piece of code finished on the basis of my TA's effort in RL course. The model part is implemented by me. You can get to know how I cooperate with others through this;  
3) Other code/Neuroimaging... You can see my Matlab skill here. It is a file to process the spiking counts of neurons.
